**Project Scope - JAVA GUI**

- Develop A GUI Java application of your choice. Examples of this include a Trivia Game or the Guess Number app that we created for our last assignment and code-along.
- The app will demonstrate the use of logical operators, loops, and OOP concepts (Such as Classes and Subclasses).
- The app will utilize Swing components for the GUI and include dialog boxes (e.g., see our notes on Swing & JOptionPane) for user interactions. You are encouraged to explore other libraries as part of stretch goals.

**Program Building**

- Create your own Organization on Github, share this organization with Ms Richards.
- Pull and Push code into your repository(in our Organization)
- Add a README file to your repository where you will display instructions on how to use your app.

**Documentation & Follow-up**

- Comments: Write what you wish to accomplish and what steps you'll take to get there. When ready, identify which steps would best be served as methods and comment your code as you go!
- Project-Follow Up: Once the project is submitted, we will each take 3-5 minutes to walk through your app. Each team will name 2 Wins and 2 Challenges.

If you cannot complete the Project Follow-Up in person with Ms Richards, you can record a 1 minute Loom Demo of your project, walking through the code. You do not need to record yourself on camera but do record your voice as you share your screen.
